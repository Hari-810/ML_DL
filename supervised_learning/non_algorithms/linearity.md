### **What is a Linear Relationship? (Linearity Explained Simply)**

A **linear relationship** means that when one variable **changes**, the other variable **changes in a consistent way**—either increasing or decreasing at a constant rate.

#### **1. Simple Example:**

Imagine a **salary** that increases by **$5000** for every extra **year of experience**:

\[
\text{Salary} = 5000 \times \text{Years of Experience} + 30,000
\]

This is **linear** because:  
✅ A 1-year increase **always** adds $5000 (constant rate).  
✅ When plotted on a graph, it forms a **straight line**.

### **2. Mathematical Definition of Linearity**

A relationship between two variables **\( X \) and \( Y \)** is linear if it can be written as:

\[
Y = mX + c
\]

Where:

- **\( m \)** = slope (how much Y changes when X increases).
- **\( c \)** = intercept (value of Y when X = 0).
- **\( X \) and \( Y \)** are related in a **straight-line fashion**.

### **3. Examples of Linear and Non-Linear Relationships**

✅ **Linear Relationships:**

1. **Temperature & Ice Cream Sales:** More heat → more ice cream sold (**steady increase**).
2. **Study Hours & Exam Score:** More study → higher marks (**constant improvement**).
3. **Distance vs. Time at Constant Speed:** Walking at 5 km/h → Distance = **5 × Time**.

❌ **Non-Linear Relationships:**

1. **Population Growth:** Population often grows **exponentially**, not linearly.
2. **Car Speed & Fuel Efficiency:** Fuel usage changes in a **curved** way, not a straight line.
3. **Stock Market Prices:** Prices fluctuate unpredictably (not a constant trend).

### **4. Graphical Intuition**

🔹 **Linear:** 📈 **Forms a straight line** (y = mx + c).  
🔹 **Non-Linear:** 📉 **Forms a curve** (quadratic, exponential, logarithmic, etc.).
